    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Vegetarian Biryani is a fragrant, flavorful rice dish made with a medley of vegetables, spices, and herbs.
        Popular across South Asia, it is a hearty and satisfying meal that doesn‚Äôt compromise on taste.
        Unlike meat biryanis, the vegetarian version emphasizes the freshness of the produce and the aromatic richness
        of the spices.
